# Interfacing API for Multidisciplinary model integration

The project will create a an integrated modelling environment that facilitates 
interaction of models from different disciplines using different methodologies (optimization, simulation,
quantitative/qualitative) and written in different languages. 

The default programming language is **python** and data file format is 2-dimential tables (in csv, excel, jason, etc).
